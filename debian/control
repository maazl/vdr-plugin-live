Package: vdr-plugin-live
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, ${vdr:Depends}
Description: Web administration plugin for VDR
 Live, the "Live Interactive VDR Environment", is a plugin providing the
 possibility to interactively control the Linux Video Disc Recorder VDR and
 some of it's plugins from a web interface.
 .
 Unlike external programs, like the VDR web frontend "VDRAdmin-AM", that 
 communicate  with VDR via its SVDRP socket interface, Live has direct
 access to VDR's data structures and thus is very fast.
